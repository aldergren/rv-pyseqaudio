rv-pyseqaudio, an RV package for easily adding audio to a sequence of image sources.

Installation
===

 1) Create a package file:

	$ zip -j seqaudio-1.0.1.rvpkg rv-pyseqaudio/*

 2) Copy the package to your RV support area:

 	$ cp seqaudio-1.0.1.rvpkg $RVHOME/PlugIns/Packages

 3) Install the package in RV; either in the UI or via the command-line:

 	$ rvpkg --install $RVHOME/PlugIns/Packages/seqaudio-1.0.1.rvpkg

Usage
===

 1) With a sequence of image sources selected, from the Audio menu, select
    'Add Audio to Sequence' and pick an audio file.

 2) A new stack is created, using your sequence as the "video track" and the
    audio file as the "audio track".

Limitations
===

 1) Stack length is equal to the longest input. I.e. if the audio is longer than
    the video, the "video track" will be black.
